          <h3>Tracing My Path Through Cybersecurity, Software Development, and Privacy Engineering</h3>

          <p><strong>Nemanja Milanovic<br />Old Dominion University<br />Dr. Sherron Gordon-Phan<br />11/18/2025</strong></p>

          <h3>Introduction: Making Sense of My Story</h3>
          <p>
            When reflecting on my experience of entering such areas as cybersecurity, software
            development, and privacy engineering, I am more likely to think about how my experience is
            coherent with what McAdams (2013) explains as narrative identity and the personal narrative that
            we create to establish our identity and the identity we are becoming. It was not a straight line on my
            path. Instead, it was a gradual process inspired by curiosity, sudden opportunities, and the places
            that were brought about by them in their formation. According to Nguyen (2019), our stories have
            meaning when we comprehend how the contexts in which we are affect our choices. In my case,
            such environments were college classes, coding bootcamps, and later fast-paced environments
            within companies like Meta and TikTok.
          </p>

          <p>
            The ensuing pages explore the events that have led me from being inquisitive about
            technology to a position where I am a privacy engineer and my work is at the perimeter of security,
            software, and human behavior.
          </p>

          <h3>Early Curiosity: Discovering the World Behind the Screen</h3>
          <p>
            Before I had the titles and the technical vocabulary, I was intrigued by the mechanisms of
            digital systems. I was such an individual that I wanted to know not only how to operate some
            technology, but why the technology acted in particular manners. According to Smith (2017),
            individuals usually invest in academic or professional fields when they make sense of them within
            their sense of meaning. That was true for me. Cybersecurity immediately appealed to me—the
            thought of securing systems, thinking like an attacker, and finding vulnerabilities seemed both
            difficult and natural.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was unfamiliar with particulars in the field, but I had strong intuitions in attending to detail,
            perseverance, and an interest in knowing how things break.
          </p>

          <h3>Beginning My Academic Journey in Cybersecurity</h3>
          <p>
            I made my first significant move in 2020 by joining the Associate of Applied Science in
            Cybersecurity at Tidewater Community College. I expected mostly labs and configurations—but
            was shocked by how much writing was involved. The essays challenged me. This aligns with
            McAdams (2013), who states that identity develops when expectations clash with new realities.
            Those struggles matured me.
          </p>

          <p>
            I discovered myself learning outside the classroom, self-teaching tools and skills well beyond
            requirements. Independent learning became a core part of my academic identity. By graduation in
            2022, I was committed to a future in information security.
          </p>

          <h3>CodePath and the Unexpected Pull Toward Software Development</h3>
          <p>
            A major shift occurred in summer 2022. I joined CodePath’s Python/software development
            course expecting an easy add-on to my cybersecurity foundation—but instead fell in love with
            programming. Writing code felt creative and empowering.
          </p>

          <p>
            I continued into their Java backend course, which led to my first industry role as a Test
            Automation Engineer. This was a defining moment. As Nguyen (2019) explains, narratives expand
            as new possibilities shape our direction. Software development opened pathways I had not
            previously considered. I realized development skills would strengthen my cybersecurity and help
            me transition toward privacy engineering.
          </p>

          <h3>Growing at Meta: From Automation to Privacy Engineering</h3>
          <p>
            In late 2022, I joined Meta (via Solvd Inc.) as a Test Automation Engineer. Although automation
            was the primary focus, my responsibilities gradually shifted toward privacy. I analyzed regulatory
            guarantees, reviewed engineering evidence, and evaluated how microservices handled sensitive
            data. I examined databases, code behavior, and compliance evidence across cross-functional
            teams.
          </p>

          <p>
            This became my first true exposure to privacy engineering—and it felt natural. The blend of
            secure design, technical analysis, and real-world risk assessment aligned perfectly with my
            interests. I found myself comfortable bridging engineering with regulatory interpretation, a rare and
            valuable intersection.
          </p>

          <h3>Advancing at TikTok: Building Structure in a Fast-Paced Environment</h3>
          <p>
            In 2024, I transitioned to TikTok as a Senior Privacy Specialist. I assumed ownership of a
            massive compliance system covering 150+ features. My responsibilities included interpreting
            regulatory requirements into technical expectations, auditing engineering evidence, and validating
            whether systems aligned with privacy commitments.
          </p>

          <p>
            Privacy engineering revealed itself as an interdisciplinary field blending law, ethics, and
            engineering—reinforcing trends in my professional journey. Smith (2017) argues that identities
            emerge from recognizing patterns in our choices and environments. Looking back, every prior role
            undeniably pointed me toward privacy.
          </p>

          <h3>Returning to Academia: Reinforcing My Foundations at ODU</h3>
          <p>
            In 2024, while working full-time in privacy engineering, I returned to academia to pursue a
            bachelor’s degree in cybersecurity at Old Dominion University. Concepts that once felt abstract
            now directly connected to my work at Meta and TikTok. Even writing-heavy courses became
            opportunities to articulate technical decisions more clearly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Nguyen (2019) argues that narratives deepen when tied to present meaning. My academic
            work became a bridge between formal learning and real-world application.
          </p>

          <h3>Where I Stand Now: Embracing a Professional Identity</h3>
          <p>
            I recently accepted a new role as a Privacy Engineer. This moment feels like the culmination
            of every narrative thread—cybersecurity, development, privacy compliance, and my interest in the
            intersection of human behavior and technology.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each experience contributed to the identity I now confidently claim:
            a privacy-oriented engineer who understands technology, risk, regulation, and design.
          </p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            McAdams (2013) defines narrative identity as the evolving story we tell to make sense of our
            lives. My journey—from early curiosity, through academic challenges, engineering roles at Meta
            and TikTok, and now professional privacy engineering—shows a coherent thread built through
            growth, adaptation, and opportunity.
          </p>

          <p>
            I never fully knew where I was going, but each experience added depth to my identity. My story
            continues, but today I stand more certain than ever of the professional I have become.
          </p>
